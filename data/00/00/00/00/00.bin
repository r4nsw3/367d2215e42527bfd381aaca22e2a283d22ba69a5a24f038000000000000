  |   Psikyo is coming back! Dragon Blaze for Nintendo Switch.              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, Moon and Sun. These four magic stones and   |
  |   the gods of moon and sun brought prosperity in Megalith. Because of   |
  |   that, the people lived a peaceful and prosperous life.                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   However, their peaceful life ended when Nebiros and his armies        |
  |   appeared.                                                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Long time ago, during the war of the gods when the world was          |
  |   created, Nebiros was defeated by the gods of the sun and moon. He     |
  |   was locked up by the 4 magic stones but was freed by summoning a      |
  |   country which aims to achieve victory in the war using him.           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Nebirus, as a revenge, controlled the mind of the god of the moon     |
  |   using his dark power. The god of the universe transformed people's    |
  |   form and spirit into hideous ones and made them as his armies. And    |
  |   the entire Megalith fell into the abyss of destruction and chaos.     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Nebirus' army has started to move towards the god of the sun. The     |
  |   god of the sun, who was threatened by Nebirus' move, entrusted the    |
  |   weapons of the gods to 4 dragon knights and ordered them to           |
  |   overthrow Nebirus.                                                    |
